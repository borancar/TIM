*Last updated 2026-08-28.*

Reconstruction of **The Incredible Machine** (Dynamix / Sierra, 1993) from
`incredible-machine/TIM.EXE`.

**Which world this is in:** the original is **compiled C** (Borland C++ 1991,
large model), not hand-written assembly. A byte-exact *matching* decompilation
is therefore possible in principle. It is **not** what is being attempted yet;
the present standard is behavioural equivalence proved by differential
verification, and any move to matching would be a deliberate change of goal.

**Which variant:** `TIM.EXE` is the only executable, but its video driver
`VM.OVL` is a container of **eight per-adapter drivers** - `VGA`, `EGA`, `MCG`,
`CGA`, `TAN`, `HEG`, `EVG`, `EVA`. Only the **VGA** driver is being
reconstructed. The other seven are deliberate non-goals, listed here rather
than left looking unfinished.

## Done - and what was actually checked

- **The executable is recovered and the recovery is proven.** Not "it unpacked
  and looked plausible": `tools/verify_unpack.py` loads the emitted EXE and
  compares it against what the LZEXE stub itself produced in memory - all
  **214,512 bytes identical**, and CS, IP, SS and SP equal. The relocation
  table was *measured*, by running the stub at two load segments and diffing,
  and the run reports zero bytes that differ for any other reason.
- **The resource archive format is verified against the bytes**, not inherited.
  All four data files walk to exactly their own size, 159 subfiles, and the
  offsets found by walking are the offsets `RESOURCE.MAP` lists. See
  `docs/resources.md`, which marks separately the one thing taken on trust and
  not checked: the name-hash function, which is not needed to read the archive.
- **The game runs under the emulator** through the Sierra logo, the title
  screen and the credits screen, in 640x400 16-colour planar, page-flipped.
- **Captures are reproducible.** They are taken on the guest's own cue - the
  page flip that makes a composed frame visible - and the machine runs on a
  virtual clock driven by emulated instructions, so a given capture is the same
  capture on another machine and after a rebuild.

## Open

### Coverage - as last measured, 2026-08-28

| | |
| --- | --- |
| call targets found by recursive descent | **577** |
| reached by the title screen, flips 6..40 | **218** |
| transcribed | **2** |
| verified against the original | **0** |
| proven (ran, did work, agreed) | **0** |

**Nothing is verified yet.** Two routines are transcribed - `vm_set_display_lines`
at 0x08f77 and `frame_pending` at 0x0b4e2 - and neither has been run against the
original. Transcribed and verified are different claims and the second is worth
far more; this row will stay at zero until a differential check exists.

The 577 come from direct calls only. Indirect calls through handler tables are
**not** followed yet, so the true figure is higher - finding those tables is the
next high-leverage task, not an afterthought.

The 218 is measured by `tools/reached.py`, which records the basic blocks
executed between two page flips and intersects them with the code map. The
title screen also reaches **263 distinct blocks inside `VM.OVL`**, which are not
in the 577 at all because the overlay is loaded at run time and the static map
does not see it.

### The original's translation units

Large model, so each module is its own code segment and the boundaries are read
off the binary rather than guessed. Eight of them:

| segment | image range | routines |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0000` | 00000..0dff0 | 270 |
| `0dff` | 0dff0..14de0 | 69 |
| `14de` | 14de0..1c250 | 32 |
| `1c25` | 1c250..248f0 | 112 |
| `248f` | 248f0..26190 | 20 |
| `2619` | 26190..2a040 | 69 |
| `2a04` | 2a040..2d290 | 4 |
| `2d29` | 2d290..2d3c0 | 1 |

Which of these are the C runtime rather than the game is **not yet
established**. Segment `0000` contains the Borland startup (the entry point is
`0000:0000`) and also game code - the CRTC routine at 0x8f77 - so it is not a
clean split, and the question is open.

### Emulator gaps closed, and where they belong

All four were found by this game and all four are generic; they live in
`TimMachine` in `tools/tim.py` and **have not been pushed upstream yet**.

1. **INT 10h AH=1Ah and AH=12h** were unimplemented.
2. **Program memory ownership.** An EXE with `maxalloc = 0xFFFF` owns all of
   conventional memory until its runtime shrinks it with AH=4Ah.
3. **Vertical blanking was ignored** by the planar renderer.
4. **CRTC registers read back as 0.** The register file now starts from the
   BIOS's own mode-12h table. This one is the cautionary example: the game
   reads Overflow and Maximum Scan Line back before setting one bit in each, so
   with reads returning 0 it silently cleared every other timing bit - and it
   *happened to reach the same blanking line anyway*, so nothing looked wrong.

### Known gaps, not argued away

- **The emulated instruction rate is a guess.** `drive.DEFAULT_IPS` is
  2,000,000, chosen and not measured. It sets the frame rate the guest believes
  it is achieving, so no timing claim can be made until it is measured against
  the original in cycles.
- **Sound is not modelled.** `SX.OVL` is loaded but the sound path is unchecked.
- **`VM.OVL`'s other seven drivers** are never executed and never will be.
- The **name-hash** in `RESOURCE.MAP` is not derived.

## Next

1. Find the **handler tables** and re-seed the code map through them; the 577 is
   a floor, not a count.
2. Establish which segments are the C runtime and which are the game.
3. Decide which of the 577 are the **Borland C runtime**. Those are not the
   game's logic and reconstructing them from Borland's binary is both pointless
   and worse legally; the port uses the host's C library and marks them as
   ours, kept out of the verifier's dispatch. Which routines those are is not
   yet established.
4. Build the **differential verifier** - stop at a routine's entry, capture the
   machine, let the original body run to its return, run the C on the same
   capture, and diff. Until that exists no routine can move from transcribed to
   verified.
5. Continue transcription, targeting the **two intro screens** - the title screen
   (page flips 6..279) and the credits screen (from flip 280) - both of which
   animate and so exercise real game logic, and prove each routine against the
   original rather than against the screen.

## Deferred

- Matching (byte-exact) decompilation.
- The seven non-VGA drivers in `VM.OVL`.
- Sound.
- Anything past the intro screens: the menu, the puzzles, the level editor.
