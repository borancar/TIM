 * Which of the seven voices is playing a given sequence. The argument is the
 * sequence's far pointer; the answer is the voice's record, also as a far
 * pointer in DX:AX, or null.
 *
 * The seven voices are a table of far pointers at DGROUP 0x6414, four bytes
 * apart. A voice matches when the pointer it keeps at its own +0x166 equals the
 * one asked for **and** the byte at +0x158 is not 0xff - the second test is
 * what excludes a voice that still remembers a sequence it has stopped
 * playing.
 *
 * The original re-loads the table entry twice more after the `les`, and keeps
 * ES from the first load while doing so. That is only a compiler making the
 * same address three times, not three different pointers.
