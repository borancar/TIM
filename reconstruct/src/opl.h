/* An OPL2 (YM3812) - the chip on an AdLib card.
 *
 * NOT TRANSCRIBED, and there is nothing to transcribe it from: an OPL2 is
 * hardware, so no routine in vgalemmi.exe implements one. It sits on the same
 * side of the boundary as SDL and as the bit-plane assembly in sdl_io.c -
 * something the port needs because the machine the original ran on is gone.
 * See "WHAT THE HARDWARE USED TO DO" there.
 *
 * The line this must not cross is into the game. What registers get written,
 * and when, is the DRIVER's decision - `adlib.dat`'s sequencer - and that is
 * transcribable, is checked against the original's own register stream, and
 * belongs in the port proper. This file's job stops at turning register
 * writes into samples.
 *
 * Implemented over ymfm (see ../vendor/README.md), which is C++, so this
 * header is the C boundary and opl_ymfm.cpp is the only C++ in the build.

 * AND THE CHIP RUNS WHILE IT HAPPENS. The driver reads the port twelve times
 * after the register and about forty after the value (adlib.dat +0x0559),
 * which is the YM3812's settling time - 3.3 us and 23 us - spent on a bus
 * that takes about a microsecond a read.
 *
 * This header used to say those reads "carry no state and have no
 * counterpart here". That was wrong, and it is the difference between music
 * and a hollow version of it. Without them every register write of a driver
 * tick lands at ONE INSTANT and the chip advances only afterwards: notes
 * key off and on again with no time in between, envelopes never get their
 * attack, and the result is thin and half as loud.
 *
 * Measured: DOSBox's own register stream, quantised onto the port's tick
 * grid, falls from an RMS of 1354 to 703 and takes on exactly the hollow,
 * collapsing profile the port had. Spreading the writes again restores it,
 * and 59 us of spacing does as well as 1000 - what matters is that the chip
 * advances AT ALL between writes, not by how much. */
