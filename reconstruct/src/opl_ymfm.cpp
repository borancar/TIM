 *
 * An OPL2's three added waveforms are RECTIFIED - half-sine, absolute sine
 * and quarter-pulse - so every voice using one carries a positive offset
 * proportional to its envelope. The offsets of nine channels swell and decay
 * together and the sum wanders at a few hertz.
 *
 * A real AdLib never emits that: the YM3014B feeds an op-amp through a
 * coupling capacitor, and the card's output is AC. ymfm models the CHIP, so
 * it hands back the raw sum, offset and all - correctly.
 *
 * Measured against DOSBox playing the same level: 43.3% of the port's total
 * power was in 0-4 Hz where DOSBox had 0.0%, and the music was left riding up
 * and down on it at a quarter of DOSBox's RMS. Inaudible on its own, and it
 * eats the headroom the music needed.
 *
 * One pole, about 5 Hz, which is where a coupling capacitor of that era sits.
 * It is NOT a tone control and must not become one: everything above 20 Hz is
 * untouched to within a hundredth of a decibel. */
