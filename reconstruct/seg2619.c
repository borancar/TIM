 *
 * The original takes and returns a far pointer in DX:AX and leaves DX - the
 * segment - untouched, so only the offset moves. The port has no segments, so
 * the target and the offset are passed separately: `rec` is what the pointer
 * points at, `off` is the offset half that the arithmetic is done on.
