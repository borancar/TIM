 * Flush up to two pending volume changes to the driver, round-robin over the
 * sixteen channels, and remember where to resume.
 *
 * The array at the module's own `cs:0x1c8` holds one byte per channel, with
 * 0xff meaning nothing pending. A channel with anything else is marked 0xff
 * again and its value sent to the driver as MIDI controller 7 - volume - on
 * that channel.
 *
 * **At most two per call.** The scan then stops wherever it is, and `cs:0x206`
 * carries that position into the next call, so sixteen channels are serviced
 * over eight calls rather than all at once. This runs from the timer tick, and
 * sending sixteen controller changes inside one interrupt would be the thing
 * it is avoiding.
 *
 * The scan is also bounded by returning to where it started, so a pass with
 * nothing pending walks the ring once and stops rather than spinning.
 *
 * The original reaches the driver by a far call through `cs:[0x1e7]` with the
 * function number in BP; 7 selects `sx_controller`, which is what the port
 * calls directly. The number is fixed for this driver, not looked up.
 *
 * This is hand-written assembly - no frame, no arguments, a near `ret`.

 *
 * Handle one MIDI note event out of a sequence, and answer the stream cursor
 * advanced past it.
 *
 * Hand-written assembly taking everything in registers: `ds:bp` is the cursor
 * into the note stream, `es:bx` the sequence's record, `si` the raw channel and
 * `al` the channel the driver should be told about - or 0xff for a channel that
 * is not being played.
 *
 * Two bytes are consumed, the note then the velocity, and the word counter at
 * `+0xc + 2 * si` is bumped once for **each byte**, not once for the event.
 * Those two increments use the raw channel; everything after uses the mapped
 * one, read from the byte table at `+0x8c` and masked to four bits. The two
 * indices are easy to conflate and are not the same.
 *
 * A non-zero velocity is a note on: the note is recorded at `+0x125 + channel`
 * and the driver told to start it. A zero velocity is a note off - the MIDI
 * convention, rather than a separate message - and it clears `+0x125` **only if
 * the note there is the one being released**, so a channel that has already
 * been given a different note is left alone.
 *
 * The record is updated either way. Only the call to the driver is skipped when
 * the channel is 0xff or the flag at `cs:0x209` is set, so muting stops the
 * sound without letting the sequence's own state drift.
 *
 * The driver is reached through `cs:[0x1e7]` with the function number in BP: 5
 * to start, 4 to stop, which are `sx_start_note` and `sx_stop_note`.

 * 0x280fe
 *
 * Handle one pitch bend event out of a sequence, and answer the stream cursor
 * advanced past it. The register convention is `midi_note_event`'s at 0x27ee1,
 * and so is the byte accounting: two bytes consumed, the per-byte counter at
 * `+0xc + 2 * si` bumped twice with the **raw** channel, everything after using
 * the mapped one from `+0x8c`.
 *
 * Two bytes are read, and the pair is put together the way MIDI does it -
 * `(msb << 7) | lsb` - by rotating the low bit of the most significant byte
 * into the top of the least. The result goes to the sequence's own store at
 * `+0xbc + 2 * channel`.
 *
 * **Bit 15 of that word is sticky.** Before the new value is written, the old
 * one is tested and its top bit carried into the new; a 14-bit bend can never
 * set it, so nothing this routine writes will ever clear it once something else
 * has. It is a flag living in the spare bit of a value, not part of the bend.
 *
 * There is an extra gate this event has and the note event does not: with
 * `cs:0x1fe` non-zero, a channel whose byte at `cs:0x128` is not 0xff is
 * dropped entirely - after the two bytes have been consumed and counted, so the
 * stream stays in step either way.
 *
 * As before, only the call to the driver is skipped for an unplayed channel or
 * a set `cs:0x209`; the stored bend is updated regardless. The driver is
 * reached with function number 10, `sx_pitch_bend`, and gets the *original*
 * register pair rather than the assembled value - it does its own assembly.
