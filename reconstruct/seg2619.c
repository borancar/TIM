 * offset 1, and there is a two-byte header, so the next record is
 * `off + rec[1] + 2`.
 *
 * The original takes and returns a far pointer in DX:AX and leaves DX - the
 * segment - untouched, so only the offset moves. The port has no segments, so
 * the target and the offset are passed separately: `rec` is what the pointer
 * points at, `off` is the offset half that the arithmetic is done on.

 * The original walks by overwriting its own stack arguments, and tests the
