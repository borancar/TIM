/*
 * 0x20079
 *
 * Fill a rectangle, clipped, and optionally outline it.
 *
 * The fill is done by turning the rectangle into a **span list** - the first
 * row, the row count, then one `x1, x2` pair per row, all identical - and
 * handing it to the driver at VGA:0x0be6 through the vector at DGROUP 0x43b2.
 * That is a general span filler being used for the simplest possible case,
 * which is why a solid rectangle costs one entry per scan line.
 *
 * Clipping shrinks the rectangle in place against the box at DGROUP
 * 0x3894..0x389a, and the original x and y are pushed before that and popped
 * back afterwards, because the outline below wants the unclipped ones.
 *
 * The outline at 0x2013f is **not transcribed**. It draws four lines through
 * 0x21e34 with a stack-reuse trick - each call pushes only the arguments that
 * differ from the last and relies on the rest still being there - which has no
 * honest expression in C without modelling the stack. It is never reached on
 * the intro screens: over 2,108 calls the two border bytes at DGROUP
 * 0x389d/0x389e - the driver's own colour bytes, seen through DGROUP - were
 * always equal, which is the condition that skips it.
